# Veramo SDK for cheqd: did-provider-cheqd

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

The purpose of this package is enable users to create and update DIDs on the cheqd ledger, using the Veramo SDK. It includes veramo agent methods that can be utilised both on an application level or through the [`@veramo/cli`](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/cli) package.

The packages utilises the main functionality existing within [`@veramo/core`](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/core) and extends this to include cheqd ledger functionality, such as creating and managing DIDs.

This is the first provider plug-in that utilises the `did manager update` method which offers a full body update of a DID (identifier) rather than individual field update transactions used more commonly. Through this through it is possible pass all did updates in one transaction.

Additionally, this package enables passing of a raw payload (e.g. a diddoc JSON), rather than following the field-by-field update, also more commonly used by did providers leveraging Veramo Core)

### Architecture

did-provider cheqd consumes functionality that exists within the [`cheqd-sdk package`](https://github.com/cheqd/sdk) in a way that complies to the Veramo `AbstractIdentifierProvider`.

It uses the [veramo key management system](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/key-manager) (KMS) to store the state of the client, and write to the ledger for create and update operations.

This package works alongside the core veramo packages:

* [`@veramo/core`](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/core)
* [`@veramo/cli`](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/cli)
* [`@veramo/credential-w3c`](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/credential-w3c)

Below is an architecture diagram illistrating the relationships between these packages.

### Setup

Dependencies can be installed using Yarn or any other package manager.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Config

A default agent configuration is provided with the [`agent.yml`](https://github.com/cheqd/did-provider-cheqd/blob/main/agent.yml) file.

To specify further configurations, see the Veramo docs, however when making changes, ensure the cheqd specific suggested configurations are retained.

### Deploy

`did-provider-cheqd` supports the same out of the box use cases as Veramo provides.

As such, this can be utilised in a backend (server-side) envrionment or frontend (browser/web) application, or in a CLI specific applications by leverage [`@veramo/cli`](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/tree/next/packages/cli).

## üìÑ Documentation

Veramo offers a number of application specific guides (see below):

* [CLI Tool](https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/cli_tool)
* [Node](https://veramo.io/docs/node_tutorials/node_setup_identifiers)
* [React](https://veramo.io/docs/react_tutorials/react_setup_resolver)
* [React Native](https://veramo.io/docs/react_native_tutorials/react_native_setup_identifers)

With each of the guides mentioned here, you can customise the steps for the cheqd ledger. To do this, after insalling each veramo package dependency required, install `@cheqd/did-provider-cheqd` with the package manager of your choice (i.e. yarn / npm).
