# Overview
## Tags

Here we are going to use tags from eslint plugin:
### The Tag is one of the following:

- Fix - for a bug fix.
- Update - either for a backwards-compatible enhancement or for a rule change that adds reported problems.
- New - implemented a new feature.
- Breaking - for a backwards-incompatible enhancement or feature.
- Docs - changes to documentation only.
- Build - changes to build process only.
- Upgrade - for a dependency upgrade.
- Chore - for refactoring, adding tests, etc. (anything that isn't user-facing).

## Version changing
`Breaking` tag will trigger the changing of `minor` number in version
`New`, `Update` will change the `patch`
Others will not change version number.
